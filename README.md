# Tweakr

Tweakr is a web-based application that suggests closely related English words based on the user's input. It is designed to find the minimal number of deletions or insertions needed to transform the input string into real English words. 

## Features

- **Minimal Edits**: Instantly provides English words that require a minimal number of deletions or insertions to match the user's input string.
- **Dynamic UI**: Features a beautiful animative background to enrich user experience.
- **Real-Time Results**: Automatically updates the suggestions as the user types in each character.

## Under the Hood: Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Edit Distance Algorithm**: Employs dynamic programming to calculate the minimal number of edits required to transform the input string.
